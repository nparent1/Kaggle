# Predict Future Sales Kaggle Competition


First Kaggle Competition attempt. We chose to use gradient boosted regression, and managed to get a prediction, though didn't score notably high on the leaderboard. Through this process we did a variety of clever things to try to get better predictions, manipulating predictors and adding interaction terms, but were ultimately limited by our lack in knowledge of time series.
